# From Debian to Web App via Terminal Commands



Often when I read documentations or tutorials about a technology, I wish it was just a list of commands and not a textual description which tells you which programs to open, which files to edit, where to save them etc.

So I made a demo how this could look like. It shows how to create a Django web application from scratch. Starting with a fresh Debian installation or container.
